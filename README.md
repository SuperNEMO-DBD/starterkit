# SuperNEMO Starter Kit

Documentation and examples for getting started with the SuperNEMO software.

Will initially reuse existing tutorials and examples, maybe use the [LHCb StarterKit](https://lhcb.github.io/starterkit/)
lessons as a template (see also https://github.com/lhcb/starterkit and https://github.com/lhcb/starterkit-lessons)
